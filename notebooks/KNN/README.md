K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

•	Preprocessing: Features were scaled using StandardScaler to ensure zero mean and unit variance.

•	Optimization: Tested $K$ values from 2 to 10.

•	Performance: > * Accuracy: 93.44% 🚀

o	Best K: 6

•	Summary: KNN proved to be the superior model in this phase, capturing complex patterns in the clinical data that the Decision Tree missed.
